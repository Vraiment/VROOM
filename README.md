VROOM
=======

VROOM is a port of the original [DOOM source code](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM) to OS X (and, in the future, possibly other platforms) with the following objectives:

-	The code must be the original code as much as possible.
-	Replace any old dependencies/subsystems by SDL2 (because is awesome).
-	Built with Xcode (again, because is awesome).
-	Build a native OS X application bundle (Doom.app) that contains all the data required to run the game (executable and WADs).

Currently is WIP, some documentation is available at the [dev blog](http://bios.host22.com).
